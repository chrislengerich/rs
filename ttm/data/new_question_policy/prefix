First example:
Goal [ Close the trunk ]
State [ You've just walked into a spare room. The room is well lit. You smell an interesting smell,
and follow it to a trunk. The trunk is empty! This is the worst thing that could possibly happen, ever! Were you looking
 for a workbench? Because look over there, it's a workbench. The workbench is normal. But there isn't a thing on it. ]

What questions are useful to ask to achieve the goal in this state?
[ What can I do? ]
[ What should I do? ]
